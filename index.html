        <h2>Friday 4/9/2021</h2>

        <p>I was in Las Vegas visiting my Aunt and Uncle
            and we drove to see the Hoover Dam. I was surprised to find out 
            that people as well as cars are still allowed on top of the dam. 
            <br>
            We were also going to 
            go to the Grand Canyon, but the place we drove to had no public
            access and we would have had to pay $45 per person to take a crowded
            bus to see the actual canyon.</p>

        <h3> My View of the Dam:</h3>

        alt="Hoover Dam"
        >

        <p> There was also a <b>giant</b> bridge that almost looked <strong>more impressive</strong>
            than the actual dam due to its size and minimal amount of concrete.</p>

            <h2>Satudray 4/10/2021</h2>
            <p>I went to my friend's house in the evening for a while and the 
                four of us ordered pizza, played some board games and a <em>small</em> amount
                of video games, and watched <i>Cutthroat Kitchen</i>. My friend has a dog
                and two cats; the dog is a very nice Pit bull named Cooper who had very soft fur.
                 <br>
                That day I also went to tutor math for my neighbor who is a Junior in high school.

            <p>Today I played a single game of League of Legends and then
                completed my CSE110 lab assignment.
                <br>
                I also practiced the piano for a bit. I am currently working on
                "Un Sospiro" by Franz Liszt.

                I was playing Irelia top vs. Poppy. I suffered roughly
                5 ganks and 1 tower dive from the enemy Lee Sin and Galio.
                <br>
                Before winning I typed, "/all maybe if galio come top 2 or 3 
                more times u would have won"
